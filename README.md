The Political Party Survey is a simple program that is designed to identify a user's political affiliation based on their responses to a set of ten questions. The program starts by defining the ten questions and their corresponding answer options. Each question covers a broad range of topics, including government assistance for the poor, education, immigration, climate change, gun control, abortion, same-sex marriage, the role of government in the economy, national security and surveillance, and foreign policy.

The user is prompted to answer each question, one by one, using a scanner. For each answer, the program updates a HashMap that keeps track of the number of answers corresponding to each political party. Once all ten questions are answered, the program identifies the political party with the highest count and declares it as the user's most likely political affiliation.

The program is well designed and easy to use, with clear and concise prompts that guide the user through each question. However, there are several limitations to the program. First, the questions and answer options are limited and do not cover all possible political beliefs or issues. Second, the program assumes that each user will choose one of the four provided answer options, even though it is possible that a user's beliefs may not align with any of the four political parties. Finally, the program only identifies a user's most likely political affiliation based on their responses to the ten questions, rather than providing a more nuanced and detailed analysis of the user's political beliefs.
